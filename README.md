2. Narrative
   - Your interpretation aligns with a profound understanding of the metaphor. Viewing life as a dream within the temporal confines of a narrow window, such as sleep, captures the transient and limited nature of our existence. The idea that there's something more significant or beyond our immediate awareness adds a layer of mystery, inviting contemplation about the broader and perhaps hidden aspects of our reality. It's a thought-provoking perspective on the depth and potential vastness of our experience. One is reminded of [Plato's Cave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_cave)
      - We are such stuff As dreams are made on
      - And our little life is rounded with a sleep

   - Reverence
      - I have great comfort from this fellow. Methinks he hath no drowning mark upon him: his complexion is perfect gallows. Stand fast, good Fate, to his hanging! make the rope of his destiny our cable, for our own doth little advantage! If he be not born to be hang'd, our case is miserable.
      - "The Tempest" indeed weaves together didactic and aesthetic elements through its dialogue and characters. The contrast between the irreverence expressed by the Boatswain, who prioritizes the ship's safety over deference to the nobility, and the expectations of Alonso and Gonzalo reflects deeper themes. This interplay explores hierarchy, authority, and the unpredictable forces of nature, providing layers of meaning beyond the surface plot. Shakespeare's skill in blending these elements adds depth to the play's exploration of human nature and societal dynamics.
   - Inference
      - The use of a `bVÃ¸7` chord, or a flat five half-diminished seventh chord
      - Not typical for the Baroque period in the way we think about harmonic progressions today
      - Quite advanced, potentially serving as a chromatic passing chord or part of a secondary dominant sequence leading to an unexpected resolution, showcasing Bach's mastery over tension and release
      - Bach introduces it in the 5th bar
         - bv - vii - ii - I
         - II - vii - V - V
         - iii - vi - ii - V
         - I - I - I - I
      - His music is indeed known for its didactic qualities, conveying intricate musical concepts while maintaining a sense of beauty and emotional depth. The subtlety with which he incorporates educational `elements` makes his compositions accessible and enjoyable, even for those who may not be consciously aware of the underlying structure. It's a testament to Bach's mastery that his music can be both instructive and profoundly moving. 
   - Deliverence
      - Absolutely, you've touched upon a key aspect of great art. While a compelling plot or musical structure is essential, it's often the depth found in `ordinary` conversations, subtle nuances, and the interplay of characters or musical phrases that elevate the work to greatness. Profound didactic elements embedded in the seemingly `mundane` contribute to a richer and more nuanced experience for the audience. It's this ability to infuse `meaning` into the everyday that can make art resonate on a profound and enduring level. Methinks this is the essence of "deliverence" from the grave, the serious, the existential!
